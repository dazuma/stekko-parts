# bathroom-fan-mount

## Overview

This is a design for a two-piece system to mount an exhaust fan in the Ekko's bathroom window. The top piece clips to the bottom of the window screen above. The bottom piece slots into the top of the blackout screen below, and mounts a fan. The dimensions match this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD3TZ5XX but you can probably adjust some of the parameters below to fit any 120mm fan (or even a larger one) that has bolts in the corners.This prints in six pieces that have to be attached using small bolts. The holes are sized for M4 bolts; you will need four 20mm (or longer) bolts and five 16mm (or longer) bolts, along with appropriate nuts and washers.

## Using the files

Five files are provided:

* `bathroom-fan-mount.scad` is the OpenSCAD source file. If you want to tweak the design (such as change the text embossed on the mount), you must do so in this file and then export from OpenSCAD to STL or some other printable format. See the top of the file for various parameters you can modify.

* Four files ending with `.stl` which are basic printable STL exports for the various parts using the default parameters. You can print these files directly if you are okay with using the design unmodified.
