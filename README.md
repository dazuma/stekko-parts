# Stekko Parts

This is an open source archive of a few custom motorhome parts used by Daniel Azuma for his Winnebago Ekko. They are designed for a 2024 model year Ekko 22A, but may also be useful on similar units.

## FAQ

### How do I use these parts?

Files in this repository are generally [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) software. They can be opened in OpenSCAD, and from there exported as STL or other formats appropriate for 3D printing. Some files will have parameters at the top that can be tweaked to alter the designs.

### Is there a charge or license?

See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file. In general, you can use these files to print your own parts, but please see the license (a modified BSD 3-clause), if you want to redistribute the files (or any derived STLs, etc.) in any form.

### What's the deal with the name?

Our Winnebago Ekko is named "Stekkosaurus".
